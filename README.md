# Learning JavaScript 

Hi, I am Nguyen Quang Phu.

This is the document about JavaScript that I and my friend, Le Dinh Nguyen, have typed based on what we have learned at W3School.

We take a summary of them, explain some places on my point of view and doing some notes for later revision.

Hope this document is informative and helpful.

Enjoy.

Phu.
